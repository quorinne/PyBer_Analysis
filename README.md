# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of Analysis

We have been asked to analyze data for PyBer, a ride sharing service. We have created several different charts to show the relationship between number of drivers, number of rides, and average fare per city type. The data will then be used to help PyBer improve access to their ride sharing technology determine the affordability in different types of cities.




# Results
Not every type of city will have the same demand for ride sharing services, it would be rather strange if a small town such in the middle of nowhere had as many drivers and rides as a city such as New York or LA. This was made evident during out analysis of the data provided by PyBer. Please direct your attention towards the scatter plot below.

The plot above depicts the cost of fare (Y Axis) and its relationship to the total number of rides per city. As we can see rural areas have a small number of rides while urban areas have quite a bit more. Another interesting trend to notice with this plot is that the average fare is higher in rural areas likely to the limited number of drivers. If the supply is low cost will rise.

The box plot above depicts the total number of drivers per city. As we can see urban areas have the largest number of drivers by far with rural areas having the fewest. A better way to showcase this information is with a pie chart. In the Pie chart below we can see that urban areas have 80.9% of drivers while rural areas have 2.6% and suburban areas have 16.5% of drivers.

If we compare the percentage of drivers against the percentage of total rides per city type in the chart below, we will see a similar distribution. With urban areas having 68.4% of total rides by city type and rural 5.3% and suburban areas finishing off the pie with 26.3% of total rides. While not a perfect match to the percentage of drivers by city type it still showcases the higher demand for ride sharing services in urban areas. Rural and suburban areas having a small increase is likely due to the lack of public transport available such as buses or subways which we see more of in cities with larger populations.

The percentage of total fare by city type is closer to the percentage of total rides per city type than drivers per city type. As seen in the chart below urban areas have 62.7% of total fare, suburban has 30.5% and rural has 6.8%. This is likely due to the increase in drives in urban areas. As supply increases cost is lowered and more potential riders can use public transportation if the cost gets too high.

Total Fare by City Type is also shown in the line chart below as it changes over time. In this chart we notice that all three city types experience an increase in total fare towards the end of February right before the month of March.  We can also see how suburban and rural areas have a fairly stable level of total fare from March to April while Urban areas see the total fare rising and falling in larger increments more before April.

# Summary
As seen throughout this analysis the supply of drivers and total number of rides is far larger in Urban areas than rural or suburban areas. While the average cost of fare per ride is higher in rural areas when compares to urban areas. This is likely due to a somewhat higher demand of ride sharing services proportional to the population. I would assume this is due to a lack of public transportation although we lack the data necessary to make this claim with any real level of certainty. If possible, I would like to run another analysis on this data with included values for average wait time per ride and availability of public transportation. Including the average wait time per ride will let us know if potential customer waits for a driver to become available longer in any city type. For example: A wait time of ten minutes in an urban area and a wait time of thirty minutes in a rural area could indicate that urban areas have enough drivers for its ride sharing demands while rural areas lack drivers. This would also explain the higher fare cost in rural areas.
